# UPENN-Final-Cybersecurity-Project

The final project of the Cybersecurity Certificate program at UPenn consisted of three tasks:
1. As Blue Team, perform analysis of the network, the target machines and patterns of traffic and behavior
2. As Red Team, perform analysis of the exposed services, identify critical vulnerabilities of the system, and use various exploits as part of the penetration testing
3. Perform packet analysis of the network using Wireshark, identify host machines engaged in malicious and illegal activities
